Hikers familiar with the Cotswold Way might recognize it, as the path travels through this farm north to south, and another public footpath intersects it east to west, making this project a treat for future generations of hikers. The land has been farmed since Medieval times, featuring lynchets—old hand-dug terraces where different families would each own their own terraced ridge and plow it to grow crops since the 13th century.\n\nCurrently the land being planted is used for grazing by horses and cows, and for organic crop growing to feed the livestock. The initial phase focuses on joining up patches of woodland to create habitat corridors, and creating shelter from strong winds coming across the Avon valley, which will improve crop yields and make life a little more pleasant for the animals.\n\nProtect Earth have partnered with 30x30 UK to provide volunteer days for teams around the UK.
