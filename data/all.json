There’s a range of tasks, such as woodland management, pond maintenance, footpath clearance and litter picking… all helping to make our local green spaces nicer for everyone, to improve the environment, and to help you to connect with nature and boost health and wellbeing.\n\nSessions are fun, free and friendly, and tasks can be adapted for different levels of ability or knowledge. You don’t need to have previous experience and you don’t need to bring anything, just wear rough clothing and sturdy footwear. They’ll bring the tools and equipment, the gloves and the guidance, and there will be support and training for each type of activity. And free tea and coffee!\n\nBooking required so they can make sure they have enough equipment, please contact the relevant Project Officer."

From Dyrham Park on the west boundary, to Dyrham Woods, this project is filling in the gaps on a large farm between the two. Hikers familiar with the Cotswold Way might recognize it, as the path travels through this farm north to south, and another public footpath intersects it east to west, making this project a treat for future generations of hikers. The land has been farmed since Medieval times, featuring lynchets—old hand-dug terraces where different families would each own their own terraced ridge and plow it to grow crops since the 13th century.\n\nCurrently the land being planted is used for grazing by horses and cows, and for organic crop growing to feed the livestock. The initial phase focuses on joining up patches of woodland to create habitat corridors, and creating shelter from strong winds coming across the Avon valley, which will improve crop yields and make life a little more pleasant for the animals.\n\nProtect Earth have partnered with 30x30 UK to provide volunteer days for teams around the UK.

    "Description": "Haydon Bridge sits on the River South Tyne floodplain near Hexham. This project reconnects old river channels by digging shallow scrapes and planting wetland sedges. Volunteers build simple weirs from brushwood to hold water and create puddling zones. Once established, the new wetlands will host amphibians, water voles and wintering waders along quiet backwaters.\n\nProtect Earth have partnered with 30x30 UK to provide volunteer days for teams around the UK. Typical activities include tree planting, woodland maintenance, invasive species removal, and leaky dam building. Let us know if you have a preference and we’ll do our best to accommodate it. Pricing includes tea and biscuits throughout the day, and covers our management costs and additional workers in case the work on the day is only partially complete."
