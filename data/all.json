The land has been farmed since Medieval times, featuring lynchets—old hand-dug terraces where different families would each own their own terraced ridge and plow it to grow crops since the 13th century.\n\nCurrently the land being planted is used for grazing by horses and cows, and for organic crop growing to feed the livestock. The initial phase focuses on joining up patches of woodland to create habitat corridors, and creating shelter from strong winds coming across the Avon valley, which will improve crop yields and make life a little more pleasant for the animals.\n\nProtect Earth have partnered with 30x30 UK to provide volunteer days for teams around the UK.

Volunteers help rotavate and seed the area with sedges, rushes and meadow foxtail to trap silt and improve riverbank stability. In late summer the new meadow will shimmer with marsh marigold and ragged robin, supplying pollen and nectar to bees and hoverflies.\n\nProtect Earth have partnered with 30x30 UK to provide volunteer days for teams around the UK. Typical activities include tree planting, woodland maintenance, invasive species removal, and leaky dam building. Let us know if you have a preference and we’ll do our best to accommodate it. Pricing includes tea and biscuits throughout the day, and covers our management costs and additional workers in case the work on the day is only partially complete."

This project restores ancient woodland fragments by removing non-native laurel and maple, then planting native species such as beech, hornbeam and hazel. Volunteers help protect young trees with guards and spread local wildflower seed, creating nectar sources for bees and butterflies. Over time the restored woodland will link existing copses, aiding dormouse and dormouse corridors.\n\nProtect Earth have partnered with 30x30 UK to provide volunteer days for teams around the UK.

They’ll bring the tools and equipment, the gloves and the guidance, and there will be support and training for each type of activity. And free tea and coffee!\n\nBooking required so they can make sure they have enough equipment, please contact the relevant Project Officer."
